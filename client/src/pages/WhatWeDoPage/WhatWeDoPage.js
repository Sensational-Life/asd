						<h1>What We Do</h1>
						<p>
							Our mission at SENsational Life is to support and empower
							neurodiverse families; giving parents of autistic children the
							tools, strategies, and knowledge to provide and secure the support
							and services needed for an inclusive and happy life.
						</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>
							I know that the waiting game can be very long and distressing:
							waiting to get an appointment, for assessments, for help and
							support. If you are in these shoes, SENsational Life is for you.
						</p>
						<br></br>
						<p>
							I know first-hand that parenting children with additional needs
							and disabilities can be very isolating, confusing and a
							frustrating experience. One which can be incredibly draining at
							times for all the family. I overcame so much to get the support
							needed, not only for my children but for me too.
