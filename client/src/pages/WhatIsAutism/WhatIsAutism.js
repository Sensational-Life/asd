							Autism or Autism Spectrum Disorder is not an illness or a disease.
							Autism is not a medical condition with treatments or a “cure”. It
							means your brain works in a different way from other people.
							<br />
							It&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re born with or first appears when
							you&rsquo;re very young.
							<br />
							Everyone with autism is different, that&rsquo;s what makes it a
							spectrum. Some people may need little or no support. Other may
							need extra help to manage certain things such as daily tasks,
							activities, jobs or relationships.
